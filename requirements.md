How will be the UX : google style dropdown

Suggestions should appear after certain minimum characters 

Suggestion when clicked -> console.log()

lets have a limit of 10 results as a maximum number of search results (dictionary is sorted)


//backend
load the entire txt into memory on the server
Simple searching prefix based (not fuzzy) simpler

// Api behaviour
Backend should handle the trimming of top n suggestions
Result will be n sorted pattern


/Edge cases
when i clear the input then no suggestions  (optimise it later) 
(history of searches) (in memory)
